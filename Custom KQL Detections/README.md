I’ve uploaded a small selection of my KQL detections to showcase my range and capability. I’ve aimed to include at least one detection from as many areas as possible, demonstrating that I can create detections across all major attack vectors. While I’ve developed hundreds more, I’ve only shared a few examples here as a taster, since some of my other detections involve sensitive customer information.
