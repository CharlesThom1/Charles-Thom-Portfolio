I’ve built and published several of my projects here to showcase my capability in both detection engineering and security-focused development. One of the main projects is an extensive SOC web application, designed to act as a multifunctional platform for security operations. It includes an IOC scraper for collecting and managing indicators of compromise, a threat intelligence integration module, a KQL query loader, and an audit logging system that allows the app to be threat modelled and actively monitored. The platform also features a custom-built refanger utility and a few hidden interactive elements for demonstration and engagement purposes.

Alongside this, I’ve developed a QR-based sign-in/sign-out web application, complete with an admin portal to view user activity logs, manage access, and analyse session data. This project was built with both usability and security in mind, ensuring that logging and traceability are seamlessly integrated into the workflow. Across all these projects, my focus has been on combining practical SOC processes with secure, efficient and real-world applications highlighting not only technical skill, but also my understanding of operational requirements within modern cyber environments.
