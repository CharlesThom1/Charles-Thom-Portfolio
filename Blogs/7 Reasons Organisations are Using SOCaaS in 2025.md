7 Reasons organisations are using SOCaaS in 2025 
Posted in Cyber Security
In this blog, we’ll look at seven clear reasons why organisations are adopting SOCaaS in 2025. From the need for continuous threat monitoring and rapid response to the pressures of compliance, cost, and access to scarce expertise, we’ll break down why outsourcing your SOC is becoming the smart move. By the end, you’ll see how SOCaaS can help you close critical security gaps, reduce risk, and give your team the breathing space to focus on what they do best.  

Introduction: 7 reasons your organisation would benefit from SOCaaS
Cybersecurity breaches can cripple operations and destroy trust in an instant. With incidents reported daily, organisations of every size face constant risk of data exposure. Even those investing heavily in security fall victim to misconfigurations, outdated defences, or insider threats, while smaller businesses without dedicated teams struggle to keep pace with an increasingly complex threat landscape. 

That’s why many organisations, like yours, are adopting SOCaaS. SOC as a Service takes the heavy lifting of a traditional Security Operations Centre, the 24/7 monitoring, detection, and response, and delivers it in a more scalable, cost-effective package.  

Instead of recruiting hard-to-find analysts, buying expensive tools, and managing round-the-clock coverage in-house, businesses can tap into a fully staffed team that’s ready from day one. 

The Role of a SOC
A Security Operations Centre (SOC) is an essential component of modern cybersecurity. It serves as the central hub for an organisation’s security operations, where a dedicated team of professionals continuously monitors, detects and responds to cyber threats in real time. 

The SOC integrates advanced tools, processes and expertise to identify threats, mitigate risks, and ensure the organisation’s systems and data remain secure. In an era of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, a SOC provides the proactive defence necessary to protect against evolving threats. Without it, organisations face heightened exposure to breaches, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. 

Operating an in-house SOC does have its downsides; these primarily are: 

Expenses: Operating a SOC requires significant investment in personnel and training costs for staff. A SOC isn’t just the people it’s also the software, tools such as SIEM tools, Threat Intelligence sources, SOAR capabilities, Incident management trackers. As a result, these costs rack up the price for in-house SOCs. 

Expertise: Trained individuals need to be sourced; without them, the SOC team won’t be proficient. Sourcing skilled analysts is like looking for a needle in a haystack; finding individuals who can correctly mitigate potential threats and have the skill to shut down incidents is challenging, as the deficit of skilled analysts doesn’t meet the industry’s demand. 

The role of SOCaaS
SOC as a Service (SOCaaS) is an outsourced cybersecurity solution tailored for organisations that lack the resources and infrastructure to maintain an in-house SOC, while still delivering the core functions of a traditional SOC, including real-time monitoring, threat detection and incident response.  

This allows organisations to maintain a strong security posture without the need to invest in the significant costs and complexities of building and operating their own SOC. By leveraging SOCaaS, organisations can ensure their systems and data remain secure while focusing on their core operations.  

SOCaaS provides a scalable, cost-effective and efficient alternative to an on-premises SOC, offering the same level of protection without the associated overheads.

7 reasons businesses are using SOCaaS in 2025
To show the importance of a SOCaaS, below are seven reasons why organisations are using SOCaaS in 2025 

24/7 threat monitoring and response
SOCaaS delivers around-the-clock continuous monitoring, ensuring real-time detection and response to sophisticated cyber threats. This ensures that after usual business hours, your infrastructure is still constantly being monitored for any out-of-hour attacks.  

Your infrastructure remains under constant watch through a combination of automated monitoring and a team of on-call security analysts. Any incidents that occur are handled in line with agreed service level agreements (SLAs), ensuring prompt and effective response. 

Cost effectiveness
Outsourcing SOC services is more budget-friendly than maintaining an in-house SOC. Businesses save on infrastructure and technology costs while maintaining an enterprise-level security.  

The cost-effectiveness of having a SOCaaS includes the initial setup of the team. This is prepared and planned in a SOCaaS offering. 

Understanding how to choose a SOC provider can be daunting, so we’ve created this free checklist that we ourselves use to evaluate the offerings of a SOC vendor.  

Guide to choosing a SOC provider 

Access to expertise
SOCaaS provides direct access to experienced cybersecurity professionals, an invaluable asset given the global shortage of cybersecurity talent. Only the most capable and knowledgeable candidates are selected, ensuring your infrastructure is defended by professionals who have been carefully vetted for their ability to protect real-world environments. 

Scalability and flexibility
SOCaaS adapts to the changing needs of businesses, allowing them to scale services up or down as required. This is ideal for growing companies or those with fluctuating security demands.  

With clear lines of communication, a SOCaaS team can adapt to changes and adjust security measures accordingly. 

Advanced technology integration
SOCaaS providers use only the best-sourced tools available. With skilled professionals at the helm, only the most effective security solutions are selected to match the ever-growing cyber landscape.  

At Evalian, we use industry-leading security event management systems and endpoint detection and response tools to gather logs, collate data and detect suspicious activity. 

Regulatory Compliance
With stricter regulations such as GDPR and ISO 27001, SOCaaS helps businesses maintain compliance through automated monitoring, reporting and incident management.  

The fines for being incoherent towards regulatory compliance are high, and a SOCaaS team such as the one here at Evalian are already set up to follow these laws and best practices. This allows businesses to immediately align their infrastructure with the compliance requirements, eliminating the need for an adjustment period. 

Faster cyber incident response
SOCaaS reduces the time to detect and respond to threats, minimising potential damage and supporting business continuity. In contrast, an in-house SOC often involves challenges such as staff management and scheduling with limited cover, which can result in slower response times and a higher risk of breaching service level agreements.  

A SOCaaS provider offers a fully staffed, ready-to-respond team with advanced tooling designed to streamline operations. 

SOCaaS across critical industries 
Whilst every organisation faces cyber threats, certain industries face greater scrutiny due to the nature of the data they handle and process. Not only that, but many industries face specific regulatory compliance frameworks that they must comply with.
SOCaaS can provide tailored value for these sectors by combining continuous monitoring with compliance-ready reporting. Here’s a brief overview of the benefits to these industries: 

Finance:
Prime targets for threat actors, for obvious reasons. Regulatory demands, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Digital Operational Resilience Act DORA and PCI DSS, for payment card security, all require controls around monitoring and response.  

By utilising SOCaaS reporting, financial organisations can ensure real-time logs and detection, aligned with these standards.

Healthcare:
The data of patients is heavily regulated under frameworks such as the NHS Data Protection Toolkit (DSPT), and HIPAA in the United States. Healthcare institutions have been the subject of large cyber-attacks in recent years, with hundreds of thousands of patients data leaked. SOCaaS can provide round-the-clock monitoring of clinical systems, patient records and medical equipment, reducing the risk of operations being down and patients suffering as a result.  

Legal:
Legal organisations and insurers handle special category data – think highly sensitive case files and client data. Standards such as ISO 2001 and the GDPR framework require demonstrable security management. SOCaaS can help to correlate activity across systems such as client portals and email systems, catching threats before a breach is suffered.  

SaaS & Technology:
SaaS organisations face a double-sided challenge: protecting their own environments and systems, whilst also protecting their clients’ systems. Standards like ISO 27001 place the onus on SaaS providers to monitor for threats and maintain strong access controls and configurations.  

As companies scale and migrate to cloud environments, the attack surface expands significantly. Evalian’s SOCaaS can provide continuous monitoring of cloud systems, ensuring misconfigurations, unauthorised access and potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before they can be exploited.  

Other critical sectors: Industries such as transport, utilities, telecommunications, energy, and education are increasingly on the radar for threat actors. And with governments highlighting the importance of operational resilience (NIS 2 regulations for example, covering essential services), it makes sense to consider SOCaaS to reduce downtime and protect vital assets.  

Conclusion
The reality is, that cyber threats aren’t slowing; they’re evolving faster than most organisations, particularly small and medium-sized ones, can keep up with. That’s why many organisations are onboarding SOCaaS, to ensure 24/7 monitoring and faster incident response, not to mention the cost savings and compliance support without the overhead costs of hiring in-house analysts.  

By tailoring your cyber defences to your industry-specific risks and regulatory obligations, SOCaaS goes beyond generic monitoring. It can provide the in-depth intel you need and audit-ready evidence to ensure your organisation remains resilient and operational.  

Whether you’re a growing business, struggling with limited resources, or a larger organisation fed up with overheads and gaps in security coverage, SOCaaS is an ideal solution and a practical way to ensure your security posture is robust. It gives you the confidence to work effectively in your day-to-day operations, knowing someone has got your back, around the clock
