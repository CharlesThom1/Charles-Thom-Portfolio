# Charles-Thom-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of projects I have made whilst practicing cyber security, includes custom KQL detections, vibe coded web applications and technical blogs I have written. 

**Blogs:**

I havent written to many blogs, however im looking to expand this area of my repo by soon posting some more technical blogs written about real incidents in the future. I will also add some personal pen test reports that I have completed in the past to show off by ability not only to attack but write detailed well communicated reports after. 

**Custom KQL Detections:**

I’ve uploaded a small selection of my KQL detections to showcase my range and capability. I’ve aimed to include at least one detection from as many areas as possible, demonstrating that I can create detections across all major attack vectors. While I’ve developed hundreds more, I’ve only shared a few examples here as a taster, since some of my other detections involve sensitive customer information.

**Vibe Codes:**

I’ve built and published several of my projects here to showcase my capability in both detection engineering and security-focused development. One of the main projects is an extensive SOC web application, designed to act as a multifunctional platform for security operations. It includes an IOC scraper for collecting and managing indicators of compromise, a threat intelligence integration module, a KQL query loader, and an audit logging system that allows the app to be threat modelled and actively monitored. The platform also features a custom-built refanger utility and a few hidden interactive elements for demonstration and engagement purposes.

Alongside this, I’ve developed a QR-based sign-in/sign-out web application, complete with an admin portal to view user activity logs, manage access, and analyse session data. This project was built with both usability and security in mind, ensuring that logging and traceability are seamlessly integrated into the workflow. Across all these projects, my focus has been on combining practical SOC processes with secure, efficient and real-world applications highlighting not only technical skill, but also my understanding of operational requirements within modern cyber environments.
